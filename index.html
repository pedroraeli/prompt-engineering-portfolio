This is like deeper layers finding complex relationships.\n\nAfter seeing many examples, you can instantly recognize their handwriting even when it's messy. The network learned the same way!\n\nEach 'neuron' is just a simple yes/no detector: 'Does this look pointy?' If enough neurons say yes, the next layer asks bigger questions: 'Is this probably an A?'\n\nFor example, in email spam detection: First layer notices words like 'FREE!' → Second layer notices 'FREE!' + urgent tone → Final layer decides: spam or not spam.\n\nThe network adjusts its detectors by being corrected thousands of times, just like you learned handwriting through practice."
